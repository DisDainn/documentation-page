          <p><strong>What is Java?</strong></p>
          <p>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.</p>
          <p>It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.</p>

          <p>It is used for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mobile applications (specially Android apps)</li>
            <li>Desktop applications</li>
            <li>Web applications</li>
            <li>Web servers and application servers</li>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>Database connection</li>
            <li>And much, much more!</li>
          </ul>
          <br >

          <p>Some PCs might have Java already installed.</p>
          <p>To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):</p>
          <code>"C:\Users\Your Name>java -version"</code>
          <p>If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):</p>
          <code>
            "java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
            Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
            Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)"
            </code>
          <p>If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html">oracle.com</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, we will write Java code in a text editor. However, it is possible to write Java in an Integrated Development Environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans or Eclipse, which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Java files.</p>
          <p><strong>Setup for Windows</strong></p>
          <p>Steps to install java on a windows OS:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to "System Properties" (Can be found on Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings)</li>
            <li>Click on the "Environment variables" button under the "Advanced" tab</li>
            <li>Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button</li>
            <li>Click on the "New" button and add the path where Java is installed, followed by \bin. By default, Java is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1 (If nothing else was specified when you installed it). In that case, You will have to add a new path with: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin</li>
            <li>Then, click "OK", and save the settings</li>
            <li>At last, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type java -version to see if Java is running on your machine</li>
          </ol>

        <header >JavaScript and Java</header>
        <article>
          <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
          <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
        <header >Syntax</header>
        <p><strong>Java Syntax</strong></p>
        <code>
          "public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
          }"
        </code>
        <p>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a <u>class</u>. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.</p>
        <p>The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:</p>
        <code>"Hello World"</code>
        <p><strong>The main Method</strong></p>
        <p>The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:</p>
        <code>"public static void main(String[] args)"</code>
        <p>Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.</p>
        <p>For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.</p>
        <p><strong>System.out.println()</strong></p>
        <p>Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:</p>

        <code>
          "public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
          }"
        </code>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.</p>
        <p>System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file)</p>
        <p>Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.</p>
        <p>You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).</p>

          <p>A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static. There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.</p>
          <p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
          <p>A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.</p>
          <p>Types of vaiables</p>
          <ol>
            <li>local variable</li>
            <p>A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.</p>
            <p>A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.</p>
            <li>instance variable</li>
            <p>A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.</p>
            <p>It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances</p>
            <li>static variable</li>
            <p>A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.</p>
            
          </ol>
          <p>syntax</p>
          <code>"type variableName = value;"</code>
          <p>Example of Variable:</p>
            <code>
              "int myNum = 15;
              System.out.println(myNum);"

          <p>Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.</p>
          <p>There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unary Operator</li>
            <p><strong>postfix:</strong>	expr++, expr--</p>
            <p><strong>prefix:</strong>	++expr, --expr, +expr, -expr, ~, !<p>
            <li>Arithmetic Operator</li>
            <p><strong>multiplicative:</strong>	*, /,  %</p>
            <p><strong>additive:</strong>+, -</p>
            <li>Shift Operator</li>
            <p><strong>shift:</strong>	&lt&lt, &gt&gt, &gt&gt&gt</p>

          <p>Strings are used for storing text.</p>
          <p>A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:</p>
          <code>String greeting = "Hello";</code>
        
          <p>A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings. For example, the length of a string can be found with the length() method:</p>
          <code>
            "String txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
            System.out.println("The length of the txt string is: " + txt.length());"  
          </code>
          <p>The + operator can be used between strings to combine them. This is called concatenation:</p>
          <code>
            "String firstName = "John";
            String lastName = "Doe";
            System.out.println(firstName + " " + lastName);"

          <p>You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Less than: a &lt b</li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: a &lt= b</li>
            <li>Greater than: a &gt b</li>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: a&gt= b</li>
            <li>Equal to a == b</li>
            <li>Not Equal to: a != b</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>
          <p>Java has the following conditional statements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use <u>if</u> to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
            <code>int x = 20;
              int y = 18;
              if (x > y) {
              System.out.println("x is greater than y");
              }
            </code>
            <li>Use <u>else</u> to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
            <code>int time = 20;
              if (time < 18) {
              System.out.println("Good day.");
              } else {
                System.out.println("Good evening.");
              }
              // Outputs "Good evening."
            </code>
            <li>Use <u>else if</u> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
            <code>int time = 22;
              if (time < 10) {
                System.out.println("Good morning.");

              // Outputs "Good evening."
            </code>
            <li>Use <u>switch</u> to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
            <code>int day = 4;
              switch (day) {
                case 6:

          <p>Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached. Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.</p>
          <p>Types of Loops:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For Loop</li>
            <p>A simple for loop is the same as C/C++. We can initialize the variable, check condition and increment/decrement value. It consists of four parts:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> It is the initial condition which is executed once when the loop starts. Here, we can initialize the variable, or we can use an already initialized variable. It is an optional condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Condition:</strong> It is the second condition which is executed each time to test the condition of the loop. It continues execution until the condition is false. It must return boolean value either true or false. It is an optional condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Increment/Decrement:</strong> It increments or decrements the variable value. It is an optional condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> The statement of the loop is executed each time until the second condition is false.</li>
              </ol>
            <p>Syntax:</p>
            <code>for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){    
                  //statement or code to be executed    
                  } </code>
            <li>While Loop</li>
            <p>The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true. As soon as the Boolean condition becomes false, the loop automatically stops.</p> 
            <p>The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.</p>
            <p>Syntax:</p>
            <code>while (condition){    
                  //code to be executed   
                  I ncrement / decrement statement  
                  }</code>
            <li>Do While Loop</li>
            <p>The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly, until the specified condition is true. If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use a do-while loop.</p>
            <p>Java do-while loop is called an exit control loop. Therefore, unlike while loop and for loop, the do-while check the condition at the end of loop body. The Java do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body.</p>
            <p>Syntax:</p>
            <code>do{    
                  //code to be executed / loop body  
                  //update statement   
                  }while (condition);</code>
          </ul>

          <p>The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.</p>
          <p>To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation. In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings:</p>
          <code>import java.util.Scanner;  // Import the Scanner class

          class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);  // Create a Scanner object
              System.out.println("Enter username");

              String userName = myObj.nextLine();  // Read user input
              System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);  // Output user input
            }
          }</code>
          <p>Input types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>nextBoolean()--	Reads a boolean value from the user</li>
            <li>nextByte()--	Reads a byte value from the user</li>
            <li>nextDouble()--	Reads a double value from the user</li>
            <li>nextFloat()--	Reads a float value from the user</li>
            <li>nextInt()--	Reads a int value from the user</li>
            <li>nextLine()--	Reads a String value from the user</li>
            <li>nextLong()--	Reads a long value from the user</li>
            <li>nextShort()-- Reads a short value from the user</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.</p>
          <p>Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.</p> 
          <p>Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.</p>
          <p>A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:</p>
          <code>public class Main {
                static void myMethod() {
                  // code to be executed
                }
                }</code>
          <ul>
            <li>myMethod() is the name of the method</li>
            <li>static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.</li>
            <li>void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;</p>
